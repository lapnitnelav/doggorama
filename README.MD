## Doggorama

Shamelessly inspired by [this project](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/dognames/), Doggorama is a simple slash command allowing you to search dog names and their popularity.

#### How to use :
* _/doggorama topdoggos_ will give you the most used dog names
* _/doggorama name (or subset)_ will return all the dog names matching your query.


#### How it works :

Simple NodeJS application which reads the csv file, parse it and then answer to queries by searching the dog names dataset.

package.json provided to ease installation and setup.
